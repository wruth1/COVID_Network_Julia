# COVID Network Modelling in Julia

Code to accompany my paper with Richard on COVID modelling at SFU. I had working code in R but it was extremely slow and I wanted to learn Julia anyway, so I'm re-writing everything in Julia. I'm also taking this opportunity to make the project better organized and more readable.
