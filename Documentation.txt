Important Objects:
status is a wrapper containing "classes" and "students"
    "classes" is a vector of individual classes
        A class is a dictionary containing "size",  "risk" and some compartments
            "size" is the number of students in the class
            "risk" is the probability of a single susceptible in the class becoming infected by either an asymptomatic or infected individual
                Formula is 1 - (1 - p_A)^N_A * (1 - p_I)^N_I, where p_A and p_I are the probabilities of being infected by a single A or I respectively
            Each compartment is keyed by its letter (e.g. "S" or "E", specifically a string), and includes a vector of indices of the students from the class in that compartment
                Indices are to "students"
    "students" is a vector of individual students
        A student is a dictionary containing its compartment label (e.g. "S") and a vector of its class indices
            Indices are to "classes"


Important Functions:
update_S!(status_new, status_old) (a status object, a status object)
    Iterates through "classes" and randomly infects some of the susceptibles in the class
        The distribution of how many new cases arise depends on the class risk, which itself depends on the number of As and Is
    Uses values from status_old as input, and makes changes to status_new
    NOTE: Any students who are infected from multiple classes will be first removed from S and added to E in all their classes, then for each subsequent infection they are removed from and added back into E. This probably happens infrequently enough that it's not worth optimizing.
change_compartment!(status, ind_student, compatment_new) (a status object, an index from 1 to number of students, a compartment label (e.g. "S"))
    Edits status by changing the compartment of the specified student to compatment_new
    Also updates each class in which the student is enrolled by removing student's index from their old compartment and adding it to compartment_new
    NOTE: This function will be used in update_X! for all other compartments, X
add_risk!(class, infect_param_A, infect_param_I) (a class object, the proportionality constant for transmission probability from asymptomatics, the proportionality constant for transmission probability from infecteds)
    Initializes or updates "risk" in "class" based on the number of asymptomatics and infecteds


Notes:
    The first section initializes a status object. 
    Specifically, it constructs a collection of students with random classes and compartments, then computes the classes which match this randomly initialized structure.
    The result is stored in "status"
